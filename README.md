# README

GIMP Beautify is a set of GIMP plug-ins for quickly and easily beautify photos.

Thanks to all GIMP developers because they provide us a great Image Manipulation Program with a strong plug-in architecture, so we can write great plug-ins for doing more fantastic things.

!!! Important: All the beautify plug-ins have been moved to under the "Filters" menu instead of "Tools" menu.
